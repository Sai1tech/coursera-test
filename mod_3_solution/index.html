					<p>Chicken curry is a dish originating from the Indian subcontinent. It is common in the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, Great Britain as well as in the Caribbean (where it is usually referred to as curry chicken). A typical curry from the Indian subcontinent consists of chicken stewed in an onion- and tomato-based sauce, flavoured with ginger, garlic, tomato puree, chilli peppers and a variety of spices, often including turmeric, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, cardamom and so on. Outside South Asia, curry chicken is often made with a pre-made spice mixture known as curry powder. Indian chicken curry typically starts with whole spices, heated in oil. A sauce is then made with onions, ginger, garlic, and tomatoes, and powdered spices. Bone-in pieces of chicken are then added to the sauce, and simmered until cooked through.[1] In South India, coconut and curry leaves are also popular ingredients. Chicken curry is usually garnished with coriander leaves, and served with rice or roti. Even within the country, there are variations among regions. In Northern India, where the delicacy may be cooked with extra spice. Additionally, one can find the dish in several small shops as well as five-star restaurants. Depending on the style of preparation, some versions may be sweeter while others will have a creamier taste to them due to the ample use of butter and cashew nut paste. Curry powder has a unique flavour due to the combination of both savory and sweet spices. Savoury spices like cumin, turmeric, and bay leaf give the curry a deep, earthy flavour while sweet spices, like cinnamon and clove, add brightness and pep. The level of heat is determined by the type and amount of pepper used.  <a href="#top" class="toop">Back to top</a>

					<p>Aloo Paratha (lit. "potato paratha") is a bread dish originating from the Indian subcontinent. The recipe is one of the most popular breakfast dishes throughout western, central and northern regions of India as well as in Punjab . Aloo parathas consist of unleavened dough rolled with a mixture of mashed potato and spices, which is cooked on a hot tawa with butter or ghee. Aloo paratha is usually served with butter, chutney, or Indian pickles in different parts of northern and western India. Aloo parathas consist of unleavened dough rolled with a mixture of mashed potato and spices, which is cooked on a hot tawa with butter or ghee. Aloo paratha is usually served with butter, chutney, or Indian pickles in different parts of northern and western India. The key to making a good paratha always lies in kneading a soft dough and then rolling the paratha evenly. Once you get that done, stuff it with your favourite ingredients (spiced potato in this case) and then fry it on a medium-high heat. Always make sure that your tawa/griddle on which you will be making the aloo paratha is hot before you put the paratha on it. If it’s just medium hot, the paratha will take time to cook and that will result in a “not so soft” paratha. This aloo paratha is vegan. A lot of people love their parathas with ghee so you may use that in place of oil to fry the parathas. I love ghee but when it comes to my paratha, I prefer them with oil and keep them vegan.  <a href="#top" class="toop">Back to top</a>

					<p>Noodles are a type of food made from unleavened dough which is rolled flat and cut, stretched or extruded, into long strips or strings. Noodles can be refrigerated for short-term storage or dried and stored for future use. Noodles are usually cooked in boiling water, sometimes with cooking oil or salt added. They are also often pan-fried or deep-fried. Noodle dishes can include a sauce or noodles can be put into soup. The material composition and geocultural origin is specific to each type of a wide variety of noodles. Noodles are a staple food in many cultures (see Chinese noodles, Japanese noodles, Korean noodles, Filipino noodles, Vietnamese noodles and Italian pasta). The origin of thin, string-like pieces of dough that are often dried and then cooked is hard to pinpoint. What is called noodles is sometimes only considered to be the modern East Asian variety and not the general type and correspondingly its origin is usually listed as Chinese, but when it includes pasta it becomes more controversial. The earliest written record of noodles in China is found in a book dated to the Eastern Han period (25–220 CE). It became a staple food for the people of the Han dynasty. Food historians generally estimate that pasta's origin is from among the Mediterranean countries: homogenous mixture of flour and water called itrion as described by 2nd century Greek physician Galen, among 3rd to 5th centuries Palestinians atrium as described by the Jerusalem Talmud[8] and itriyya (Arabic cognate of the Greek word), string-like shapes made of semolina and dried before cooking as defined by the 9th century Aramean physician and lexicographer Isho bar Ali. In 2005 a team of Chinese archaeologists reported finding an earthenware bowl that contained remains of 4000-year-old noodles at the Lajia archaeological site. The findings were said to resemble Lamian, a type of Chinese noodle. Analysing the husk phytoliths and starch grains present in the sediment associated with the noodles, they were identified as millet belonging to Panicum miliaceum and Setaria italica. The findings being noodles was disputed because millet, being gluten-free, isn't suitable for making noodles as we know them. Wheat wasn't widely cultivated until the Tang dynasty (618–907 CE).  <a href="#top" class="toop">Back to top</a>
